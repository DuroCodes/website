[Spark](https://spark-handler.js.org) is a Discord.js handler/framework built by me.
You might be reading this and asking the question "why?".
Let's take a look at the framework and see the pros & cons of using Spark.

<br />

## Spark

<br />

Spark is a TypeScript first Discord.js framework built with simplicity and ease of use in mind. You can read all about it on the [Spark website](https://spark-handler.js.org).

<br />

## Why?

<br />

You should use Spark if you answer "yes" to any of the following questions:

<br />

- You like Discord.js & TypeScript.
- You want an easy to use framework.
- You don't want to spend time configuring a custom handler for all of your projects.

<br />

## Support Spark
