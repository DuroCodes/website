JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, and it is undisputedly the best programming language for the web.

<br />

However, with JavaScript there are a few glaring flaws.
One of the major issues is the absence of type checking makes large codebases a pain to use.
TypeScript addresses this problem, and makes JavaScript a better language for everyone.

<br />

## The Bad of JavaScript

<br />

Let's take this very simple JavaScript function, `add` that adds two numbers and returns the sum:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

add(1, 2); // 3
add(1, "2"); // 12...
```

As you can see, it's possible to pass **anything** to this function. This can cause a lot of issues when the code is more complicated than just adding two numbers.

<br />

For example, if you had a function that is supposed to only take in a `User` object, you may write something like this:

```js
function greetUser(user) {
  return `Hello ${user.name}!`;
}
```

This looks okay, until you realize that you can pass in **any value** to the function, including strings, numbers, etc.

<br />

## TypeScript Conversion

<br />

Let's address the issues with the code, using TypeScript.

<br />

The first example, where you are supposed to add two numbers would look like this:

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

To some JavaScript users, this may look a bit verbose, so let's break this function down piece by piece.

<br />

TypeScript adds the `number` type, and in this example, we're specifying that both `a` and `b` have to be numbers, simple enough.

<br />

The second example is a bit more complicated. While we can use inline types for the `User` type, we should probably put it in it's own type for re-usability.

<br />

You can make an object type with the following syntax:

```ts
// You can use an interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Or a type alias
type User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

Now that we have our `User` type, we can add it to the function.

```ts
function greetUser(user: User) {
  // You also get intellisense for the `user` variable.
  return `Hello ${user.name}!`;
}
```

## Conclusion

<br />

Overall, switching to TypeScript is a great decision in my opinion. Once you switch to TypeScript, it's hard going back to JavaScript because of the great features TypeScript provides.
