[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a great alternative to Java. It's a modern language that compiles to JVM bytecode, so it can be used to create Minecraft plugins with ease.

<br />

## Why Kotlin?

<br />

The main reason I decided to learn Kotlin over Java is because of the simplicity of the language. Coming from languages like TypeScript and Rust, Kotlin is more familiar than Java.

<br />

## Getting Started

<br />

Assuming you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, you should download the 'Minecraft Development' plugin. This will allow you to create a new project with the Paper API.

<br />

After installing the plugin, click 'Create New Project' in IntelliJ. Choose the 'Minecraft' generator, and fill in the info. Make sure to use the correct version of the Paper API.

<br />

## Setting up Kotlin

<br />

After your project initializes, it will be in Java. In order to convert it to Kotlin, rename the 'main.java' folder to 'main.kotlin', and open your main class file.

<br />

Inside your main class, press `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `K` (or `⌘ Cmd` `⌥Opt` `⇧Shift` `K`).

<br />

This should prompt you to configure Kotlin in the project, just click 'Ok', and choose the latest stable version of Kotlin. Make sure to run a Gradle/Maven sync after you add Kotlin to your project.

<br />

## Creating a Command

<br />

This isn't going to cover **everything** about creating commands, but it will cover the basics to get you started.

<br />

To register a command, you'll first need to go to the `plugin.yml` file, and add your command to the `commands` section.

```yaml
commands:
  mycommand:
    description: My command
    usage: /mycommand
```

After that, create a new package/folder called 'commands'. Inside of this folder, you'll be creating your Kotlin files for your commands.

<br />

Create a Kotlin file called `MyCommand.kt`. Inside of this file, you'll be creating your command class. For this example, we'll just be sending the player "Hello World!"

```kotlin
class MyCommand : CommandExecutor, TabExecutor {

}
```

After this, you can right click the red highlight, and click 'Implement Members'. This will add the required methods to your class.

```kotlin
class MyCommand : CommandExecutor, TabExecutor {
    override fun onCommand(sender: CommandSender, command: Command, label: String, args: Array<out String>?): Boolean {
        return true
    }

    override fun onTabComplete(
        sender: CommandSender, command: Command, label: String, args: Array<out String>?
    ): MutableList<String> {
        return mutableListOf()
    }
}
```

## onCommand() and onTabComplete()

<br />

Now that you have your command class, you can add functionality to it, this is what the `onCommand()` method is for. For this example, we'll be sending the player "Hello World!" when they run the command.

```kotlin
// inside onCommand()
sender.sendMessage("Hello World!")
```

Tab completion is used to suggest arguments for the command. For example, if you have a command that takes a player name as an argument, you can use tab completion to suggest players when the user presses tab.

```kotlin
// example that suggests players (in onTabComplete())
if (args?.size == 1) {
    return Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers().map { it.name }.toMutableList()
}
```

## Registering the Command

<br />

Now that you have your command class, you need to register it. To do this, you'll need to go to your main class, and add the following to the `onEnable()` method.

```kotlin
// inside onEnable()
getCommand("mycommand")?.setExecutor(MyCommand())
```
