In 2023, there's a ton of new tech that you can use for development, with a new JS framework coming out every week it feels like.
Here's a hand-picked list of the tools and tech I use for development.

<br />

## TypeScript

I believe that if you're not using TypeScript, you're doing something wrong.
TypeScript is amazing for many reasons, if you want an overview, you can check out my post I made about [why you should switch to TypeScript](/blog/switch-to-typescript).

## Astro

Astro has been one of the most popular tools as of 2022 with the release of Astro version 1. I use Astro a lot for static websites, like this website!

<br />

Astro is popular for a few reasons:

<br />

- Speed
- Ease of use
- Flexible

<br />

First of all, Astro is insanely fast. Astro builds all of your content into static pages, which makes your bundle have significantly less JS.

<br />

## T3 Stack

The T3 stack is a great way to build a website in 2023, I especially like the tools they use.
**Tailwind**, **TypeScript**, **tRPC**, **Prisma**, and **Next.js** are all great tools which I use all of the time.
