### Why is your name Duro?

I wanted to have a cool online alias, so I used a random word generator. It gave me the word [durometer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/durometer), so I shortened it to **duro**.

<br />

### What programming languages do you know?

I use [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) mostly, but I also enjoy [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

<br />

### What theme do you use?

I use the [Horizon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexandernanberg.horizon-theme-vscode) VSCode theme.
